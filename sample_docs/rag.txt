Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval systems with language models.

Steps in RAG:
1. Ingest documents
2. Split into chunks
3. Create embeddings
4. Store in vector database
5. Retrieve relevant chunks
6. Generate grounded response

RAG improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations.
